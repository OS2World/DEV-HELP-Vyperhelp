
Builder bugs
  no access to IViewPort styles (alwaysVerticalScrollBar, etc)
    fixed: added to vbbase.vbb
  IVBContainerControl::elementChanged does not maintain "in use" status
    ANY attribute change of associated "real" object causes this to be called!

Other bugs
  Trap in PMCTLS.DLL when trying to "collapse" an empty container
    workaround: don't do it
