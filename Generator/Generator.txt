Parser
  add cancel() support so a long operation can be canceled
    add a check to setCurrent() calls
    simply throw an exception "Canceled by user"

CodePage
  add support for "Symbol" character set
    is it a known code page?
    add a special table with known mapping?
  if translated char is 0xff, it is wrongly converted to substitution (WinCp)
    y umlaut is 0xff in CP 1004
  if translated char is 0x1a, it is wrongly converted to substitution (iconv)
  use Unicode functions for translation?

Symbol
  should symbol support substitution string?

Build issues
  Use ordinals for export? (hide interface)
  export collection class instances

Generic filter for redundant Gins
  monitor Gins as they are passed in
  save them in a GinList until an "output" gin is encountered (section, text, art, etc)
  remove redundant styles (font, color, bold, etc)
  remove useless Push-...-Pop sections

handleXxx should return true if handled
  can then add handleUnknown to allow special handling for unknown Gins
  e.g., VySectionGenerator passes on requests to FlowGenerator

General To Do
  limit IDs to 16-bit (IPF supports 16-bit, HPJ supports 32-bit)
  popup/footnotes options:
    SectionGin, level=0 flags a footnote
      implies hidden, window=footnote
    add FootnoteGin, which acts like SectionGin level=0
    (both above put burden on WinHelp parser)
    or need to add optional windowId to LinkGin?
      this is more difficult
      in IPF, panels and footnotes are distinct
  how to set main window ID (main window size, etc)
  rethink Ruler

Test cases
  "words" longer than max output line
  try max output line = 1?

generic distance units conversion?
add option to force break at column N (255 for IPF)


** QUESTIONS

Need to support default settings?
  allow writer to set a default GinList to be used when each section starts
  may also need a GinList when a section is done

** ASSUMPTIONS

  No paper output specifications (page info, etc)
  No authoring information
  There is a single basic linear order (contents)

** TARGET SPECIFIC

Need a general way to maintain target-specific markup?  Styles is one
way to do this, but is it enough?  For example:

  IPF colors: only supports a specific subset
  IPF Fonts: ditto
  IPF tables
    no nesting within
    no font/attribute/margin changes
    no artwork
  HTML <strong> and other tags for logical context
  WinHelp non-scrolling region

** STYLE SUPPORT

First release won't support "styles", but we need a way of maintaining style
information, particularly predefined styles for a given target.  For example,
IPF's :dl, :caution, :xmp... HTML's <strong>, <blockquote>, etc

We may want to define Gins for each of these styles and have the default
stream operation do the generic conversion.  For example, for StrongGin
the default << operator would send a BoldGin, however HTML would recognize
the StrongGin and override the default to output a <strong> tag.

Character styles have name, markupBefore and markupAfter.  Paragraph
styles have name, markupBefore, markupAfter, merkupBeforeRow, markupAfterRow.

** GLOSSARY/TERM SUPPORT

First release won't support Terms/Macros/Entities, but we probably want to
add this to a later release, since IPF and HTML both support it.  The idea
would be to associate a string with an identifier.  For example, "AKD" would
be "Anne Kramer Designs".

Glossary terms could also include viewer-generated stuff like current
date, filename, document title, author, etc...
