notes about Generator design decisions

IPF table quirks:
  reset colors to default
  look screwy if mono font isn't used or if bold/italic are applied
  don't allow tags between the :table and the first :row and :c
  allow color changes within the table
  allow link/hide text within a cell (can't cross cell boundaries!)

IPFGenerator's response:
  before entering a table, :hp attributes are reset and :font face is reset to mono
  _active->colors are reset to default after entering and leaving a table
  while in table, switchContext shouldn't send :hp, :font, :lm or :rm
  no formatting tags are sent between the :table and the first :row:c
  when leaving table mode, switchContext should force reset of above tags
  while in table, The forllowing are all translated to :p. :li, :lp, .br
  while in table, RulerGins which imply nesting within a table are ignored
  while in table, artwork is ignored
