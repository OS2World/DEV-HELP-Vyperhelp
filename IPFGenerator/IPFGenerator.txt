
Wish List
  for empty pages, don't insert :p (make an option?)
    gives warning in compiler, but navgiation in viewer is better

User Settings (current default)
  name for BMP files (IPFnnnn.BMP)
  starting id (30000)
  default codepage (0 = active codepage)

User Doc
  IPF Generator Limitations
    external labels can't be linked internally
    cross-file links must be same type (INF/HLP)
    empty panels will produce IPFC errors
    11/15/98 (Mat): Para followed by Ruler(preformat) generates an extra :p
      Para means "start para", but :lines causes an implicit :p
      (may be an IpfParser error?)

OS/2 bugs
  WinCpTranslateString( hab, 1004, "~", 850, cText, pszText );
    returns "substitution character" (cannot be translated)
    should map the same (both use 126 for tilde)
    APAR IC21059 may apply?
    APAR JR11067 may apply (fixed in Warp 4 FixPak 7)

IPFC quirks
  IPFC -C option (codepage) doesn't always pick up correct APS file
  -C only affects how symbols map to chars
  symbols are effectively macros -- mapped to a char at compile time

IPFC bugs
  Codepage is ignored when facename=default
  Monochrome bitmaps are inverted
    VIEW does not agree with IB or ICONEDIT or WINHELP
  "brown" is not accepted as a color
  font size is too small (smaller then specified)
    compare with same size in Font Palette
  CR after :artwork runin will not generate space if no other text is on line
  :artlink not recognized in following code (OK if space before :artwork is deleted!)
    :userdoc.
    :title.Art
    :h1.Art 1
     :artwork runin name='E:\VYPER\IPF1000.BMP'.
    :artlink.:link reftype=hd refid='BITMAP_CODEC'.:eartlink.
    :h1 id=BITMAP_CODEC.Bozo
    :p.The Bozo panel.
    :euserdoc.
  tables can't handle:
    proportional fonts
    codepage that doesn't have same codepoints for line draw characters
    bold, italic, etc
  :lm. is not equivalent to :lm margin=1. although doc says it is
    (same for :rm.)
  trap if try to nameit a symbol which is already defined
    (includes some which are defined but not documented)
  :caution, :warning, :note, :nt permanently reset bold italic and underline
  cgraphic only resets to a monospace font if the default font is active
  hp1,2,3,5,7: reset codepage to default

Codepage
  "default" codepage (0) assumes same for compiling and viewing

To Do
  symbols
    some symbols which are currently "simulated" could be displayed
    using the :font tag with codepage attribute (e.g., cp 1004)
  bitmaps
    could reduce # of generates BMP files by keeping table of id/filename/size
  Push/Pop sequences generate a lot of unnecessary :font tags
  don't allow same-topic jumps (where detectable)
  nested tables illegal
    but if they do it, should we handle row/col correctly?
  empty sections give warning
    could put in a dummy :p. tag?
  support additional :fonts??
    (no way to know what's on target system)
    if family isn't recognized, use provided facename
      IPF will use default font if it can't find a matching facename
  tables
    could make special case to allow underline in tables
  we send some unnecessary :color, :font tags
    when resetting to default after leaving a section, etc
  conversions
    % should take current margins into account
  use IFont metrics for conversions?
  better DividerGin? (not until we need it for HTML)
  workaround global/local problem?
    link by res (need to have label already defined!)
  mid-topic jumps
    curent method breaks VIEW navigation
    other metods include:
      footnote as intermediate panel
        keeps navigation and history intact
        requires 2 pass to know if link is footnote/heading
        can't link by res, can't link externally
      small panel as intermediate
        small panel remains in history
        doesn't require two passes though
    most methods require two passes to recognize mid-topic jumps
