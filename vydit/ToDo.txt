-----------------
Bugs
  dbl-click for selecting words doesn't always work
    suspect conflicts with drag-select
    try shift+dblclick too
  FlowFormatter
    if format returns a change, but doesn't fit, change won't get reported next format call
  use DEBUG_ZONE in Page.cpp to check for excessive refreshing
  after restore Kursor should be brought into View
  shouldn't shift viewport to fit LineEndView or EndView
    add View::isImportant() or something like that?

Need a general way to enumerate across selection
  used for delete and generate
  also need to keep track of nesting (orphan count)

OpenClass bugs
  IFont metrics: workaround in FontInfo::newFont
  OpenClass resets code page to 850: workaround in Symbol::setContextFont
  no virtual key event for Shift+Enter (defect #21395/talcm)
  IGRegion::boundingRect broken: workaround in Page::setRectToRegion
  enableTabStop for IViewPort doesn't work: workaround in Editor::enableTabStop()

Project
  put ASSERT and TRACE in common project header

Performance
  setState should only need to reset font once!
  eliminate all unecessary paint areas
  handle our own paging/scrolling and bypass IViewPort
    would eliminate memory graphic image
  limit object data for common items/views
    PlacedView should use a static container to hold PenStates
    can we reduce allocations by WordView?
      array of char lengths (unsigned) -- store global char lengths?
        PenState could cache char lengths
  ItemSequence can be ILinkedSequence, instead of IEqualitySequence
    doesn't use searching capabilities
  eliminate all linear searches through Items/Views

FastContext
  bg color currently hardcoded to WHITE

Support for Push/Pop
  need a way to graphically see pairings
  need special handling of selections which cross push/pop boundaries

Cleanup
  View::position() and rect() actually use line's y-position (may not be same)

Local code page support
  need token call to setlocale() to setup default environment? (done)
  need to store active code page with document

Text v Symbols
  SmartText uses isalnum() to determine what's part of a string
    automatically supports locale!
    doesn't support contractions, possessives or hyphenated names
  soft hyphen shows as unknown symbol
  ch = 0 not supported? (0 used as error return)

Format/Draw
  use a pen pattern for selection polygon to give distinctive look
  pen state change could be checked by each View::format
    saves FlowFormatter from doing it
  possible to draw partial word?

Model-View
  cursors in aux view may become invalid when items are deleted

need LeafView::isDeleteable?
generalize Command interface, support undo,redo,state save
VEdit can subclass presSpace to return a non-cached PS
  this will be used in IPaintEvent
Logical nesting is separate from Display nesting
  Logical:  Section, Ordered List, Bold, Text
  Display:  Flow, Line, Word, Char
  do we need logical nesting?  (or is inline OK?)


-----------------
Movement rules
  - Let VPort do the scrolling
  - Keep cursor visible where possible
  - Cursored line should be fully visible
  - Cursored item/character(?) should be fully visible

Concepts
  kbd cursor anchor (for resize/reformat)
  preferred x (separate from actual x)
    _kursorPoint vs _current.view().position()
  relative y position (for resize or style change)

use IScrollHandler for notification
(Scrolls include both page and single movements)
After ScrollUp/Down
  if cursor isn't visible
    move y down/up by line to visible range
    (remember lineheight may be > portalheight!)
    store relative y
  AdjustKursor
After ScrollRight/Left
  AdjustKursor

Style Change
  scroll to match relative y-pos (scroll to fit too)

--- Defer ---

Targets within text
Tables
Forms
Layouts
Borders
Hidden text
Comment text
Horizontal rules

Word movement
  Ctrl+Right/Left
Ctrl+/, Ctrl+\
  select/deselect all ??

make StringItem for handling all text-based items
  WordItem
  SpaceItem
  ...?

dictionary/lookup support

IPF Notes
  Lists always reset margins unless
    nested in another list, or
    in a Lines alignment
  Lines alignment always takes precedence, except with Figures
  Table only allows Lines to be inserted
    even then, Lines get clipped
  Nestings that don't make visual sense may still make logical sense
    e.g., List inside Caution
  Which contexts reset margins?
  Each context only allows selected others to be nested within
    how to express programatically?  canNestXXX()?  SGML rules?

Old ideas from TextEditor.TXT

Draw scheme
  How to represent different inlines
    Context
      horizontal line (annoying?)
      list box with context stack
      box contexts as list is scrolled
      in pop-up menu only?
  Read-only text (list prefixes, etc)
Line drawing mode
Clipboard format for Vyper text
Search and replace
  regular expression, etc!
Drag-drop support
  links
  cut/paste
Auto-recognize, auto-spell, etc
Auto-save to temporary file
  Undo support is related
Key mapping
Bookmarks
  is this more of an app function, like to-do list?
International
  DBCS?
  Code page
  language: static text
hook voice recognition/dictation
hook ScreenReader/2
support presentation parameters
BIDI?
