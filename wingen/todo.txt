may need to revert to sending a \par before each ruler change
  many readers will apply new styles to previous paragraph if not
  if so, need to not send \par at first ItemGin
    (this causes problems when there is text after a ruler but beofre the first item -- see all.ipf)
what to use for default character set? (850 or 1004)
  standard symbols assume ANSI (1004), we could use hex codes
  most readers ignore \cpg!
greek and math symbols aren't available in 1004
  could use Symbol font
  need to add special Symbol font support to Symbol class
better \sb\sa for headings?
  readers vary widely!

Footnote characters may be ignored if they follow raw text
  workaround: enclose footnote character in a group with its \footnote info

W = Works
D = DeScribe
B = Both (W4W filters)

B: CP 850 #245 gets doubled (so do all low ASCII < #32), see deka_01 "19a"
ignore \cpg437 in font definition, pretty universal
\f2- consumes hyphen, acts like \f0 (same with "\f2<CR>-"), see deka_01 "(CAPM)" and "Hedging"
D: rogue bullets!
W: "{zins}\fs28\f2  erworben" emits both spaces, see deka_01
\bullet and \rquote don't work with \pca, see acq "Overview"
W: "\b1<CR>Segment duration\b0", 'S' is lost
W: line spacing wrong
W: \fi\li indenting fails
D: occasional space delimiters not consumed
B: "\b0.", '.' is consumed
"\b0<CR> ", ' ' is consumed
D: \sa not honored until next paragraph
line spacing not contained by {}
D: margins not relative to 0, see gentest
