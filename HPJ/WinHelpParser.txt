WinHelpParser Notes
-------------------

Top Wish List for HPJ->IPF
  better line spacing
    extend SpacingGin
    RTF use line/para to control?
    IPF better at determining lines
  support \tab style tables
  SHG conversion
  special conversions for some ANSI charactser
    0x93 and 0x94: double quotes
  special conversions for Symbol font
    211=copyright, 212=TM, 210=Reg, 0xb7=bullet
  Filter unecessary Gins
    generic filter in Generator
    special Push/Pop filter in HPJ
  IPF left margin won't set backwards until a line wrap
    hold :p and .br until after margin is determined?
  BMP conversion loses palette (OpenClass)

WinHelp implementation notes
  if there is a space immediately following a footnote, it is ignored
  also, spaces before a footnote are ignored if there are ONLY space back to the start of the para
    for now, we just strip any spaces immediately before the footnote

HPJ Parser Limitations (ns = not supported)
  pre-defined bitmaps (bullet.bmp, etc)
  [FONTS] ns
  CHARSET option ns
  bitmap tranparent backgrounds ns (e.g., {bmct xxx.bmp})
  multiple bitmap resolutions: only first file is used
  line spacing (space before and after) may get confused
    we add \sa and \sb values
  tabs ns
    each tab is replaced with a space
  tables ns
  paragraps borders ns
  first line indent ns
  SHG, WMF and MRB ns
  embedded art ns
  popups (footnotes) ns
  non-scrolling region ns
    text appears, but scrolls
  secondary windows ns
  hypergraphics ns
  build tags ns
  CNT contents ns
    RTF file determines section ordering
  incomplete support for character sets
    Windows "Symbol" font ns
    /ansi, etc and /cpg are ok
    /fcharset and /cchs and CHARSET= are not

Links
  see flushLink: if link level is screwed up, we may lose context

Help Decompiler
  sometimes misses spaces between words
  emits incorrect fonttbl (missing semi-colons) -- HC accepts it anyway

Build issues
  Fix VP++ integration
    currently generate DEP only, no MAK
    MakeMake will not recognize VP++ action (YHH files are used by C++ compiler)

Code pages
  currently ignoring \fcharset in font definitions and \cchs in character data (and CHARSET in HPJ)
  currently assuming \cpg values map properly to "IBM" values

Windows
  add support for window specifications in CNT
  add support for window spec in LinkGin

CNT
  RtfSection should keep list of label identifiers, instead of only the first one encountered

To Do
  get rid of extra code generated in .yhh (filter for #defines)
  check all \proj\samples\winhelp
  WinHelp default panel size
    60% wide, 100% high -- is it documented?

[FONTS] support
  generalize a MapFont class to handle [FONTS], FORCEFONT and MAPFONTSIZE
    from name, from size min, from size max, from codepage
    to name. to size, to codepage
    any can be set to "ignore"
  compare should be case-insensitive

New features
  Popups
    requires 2 passes to distinguish popups from topics
  Build tags
  Tab support
    detect tabs in two-column lists??
    use left margin to simulate tabs
    may require 2 passes
  Graphic hotspots
  Inline graphics (pict)

RtfYacc
  need special %expression for binary data
  remove annotation characters (the character immed before {\annotate
  support fields?
  secondary windows
    need to add optional window ID to LinkGin
  non-scrolling region
  inline bitmaps with \pict
  for performance
    avoid Yacc, just use SSLex
    don't need to cache the whole section into a GinList
  general way of adding monitor/statemachine
    Links (_linkContents, etc)
    Footnotes (_HoldList, _holdText, etc)
    Tabs
    ...

extending RtfYacc for general RTF
  add styles support?
  make footnote/underline processing optional
  topic separation by style instead of \page

create RtfDestination class
  methods
    processControl
    processSymbol
    processText
    endDestination
    push, pop
  subclasses
    Footnote
    ColorTable
    FontTable
    Document
    etc...
  isolates dest-specific processing


add error correction to grammars
  see VP++ page 4-40

add optional try { ... } catch() {rethrow} blocks
  allows better tracing of throws

add DFA, LLR files to application as resources?
  How to
    use RESOURCE statement
    use DosGetResource
    write to temp file
    DosFreeResource
    construct SSLexTable, SSYaccTable from temp file
  create subclass ResLexTable, etc?

build tag parser
what to do with the non-scrolling region?
use outline to determine list mode
contents
  single panel -- what if it isn't found?
  for WinHelp 4.0, use CNT file
  browse sequences
convert inline graphics to IGBitmap
call user to convert unknown graphic formats?
