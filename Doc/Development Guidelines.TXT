VYGEN components
  only use "static const" for simple types: static const IString fails when more than one EXE active
    also fails for static member data !!!!!


WorkFrame Project Creation

  Use Vyper project template
  Turn off "Build Smarts"
  Generate initial MAK, but maintain by hand
  Use auto-generated DEP
  Use CFLAGS for compiler flags, LFLAGS for linker flags
