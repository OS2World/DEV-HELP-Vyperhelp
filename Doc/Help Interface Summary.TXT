This file summarizes how help is integrating using different development schemes


Basic PM
------------
WM_HELP 
  generated by buttons, accelerators, etc
  sent to the active window frame
  if help for FID_CLIENT, then send to client
if not handled by client, a HelpHook structure is created
  call hooks in order
  if no hooks, then the active help instance gets the info (?)
  help instance uses HELPTABLE to find correct panel
  if no panel is found, a HM_HELPSUBITEM_NOT_FOUND is sent to the app

OpenClass
-----------
- IHelpWindow is associated with a frame window to generate help.
Most PM functions map directly into IHelpWindow methods.
- IHelpHandler directs message coming from the help instance
back to the application.

OpenClass Message Box
--------------------
Takes a single "help ID" in the show() args.  Assume this is a
panel ID for the curently active help instance??

FileDlg or FontDlg
-------------------------
These send WM_HELP messages to their owners.  Is it possible to
support multiple different purpose FileDlgs with one HELPTABLE?
May need HelpHook, as with MessageBox

Container DM_DRAGHELP
------------------------------
This is available but it appears to be rarely used.  WPS doesn't
even support it.


WPS
------------
Workplace shell generally relies on the wpSetDefaultHelp and
wpDisplayHelp methods to handle help.  WPS manages the help
instance -- the programmer must specify the HLP file and the
panel ID.

For Settings notebook pages, a PAGEINFO struct is filled in,
including a HLP file, a default panel number and an optional
pointer to a HELPSUBTABLE.  For non-notebook dialogs, it's up
to the programmer.  Can we use WinLoadHelpTable to associate
a subtable with a dialog?  WPS doesn't use the HELPTABLE
at all, it appears.


OpenDoc
----------------
It looks like there's not enough known about this now.  Current
plans are to use the native help system, in our case IPF.  It
will probably use the same system as WPS: help is specified as
a HLP file + panel ID.  Then the document shell would be
responsible for managing the help instance??  We can generate
OpenDoc code for this is soon as the interface is defined.


SmartGuide
----------------
SmartGuide allows assigment of help by specifying the help library
(HLP) and panel ID.  This is the same as WPS and OpenDoc, and seems
to be IBM's cross-platform solution.  (SmartGuide is also cross-
platform).
