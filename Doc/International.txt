Internationalization Issues


Goals
  don't need to support DBCS or Unicode NOW, but need to have hooks

Levels of support
  1. Single language
  2. Multi-language
  3. Translation

What is needed for Level 1 + Portability??
  Wrap all string manipulation functions
  Don't assume characters are 8-bit (for Unicode or DBCS)

UICL
  handles DBCS
  use separate resources for NLS
  UICL User Guide p 21 has checklist for DBCS-enabling

CodePage
  use CODEPAGE= plus DEVINFO= in CONFIG.SYS
  character mapping
  Redbook v5, p93 has info
  DosMapCase, DosQueryCp, DosSetProcessCp
  WinCp...

DBCS
  encoding for 16-bit characters
  first character may be standard character or a DBCS "prefix"
  DosQueryDBCSEnv
  WinUpper, WinYpperChar, WinNextChar, WinPrevChar, WinCompareStrings

Unicode
  16-bit character standard
  will be used in Workplace OS

Country Info
  set by COUNTRY=code in CONFIG.SYS (code same as telephone codes)
  determines:
    default code page
    date/time/currency formatting
    collation sequence
    DBCS vector (determines DBCS prefix characters?)
  DosQueryCtryInfo, DosQueryCollate
