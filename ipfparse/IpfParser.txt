Notes for IpfParser

:font with :cgraphic/:xmp
  with any font other than default, these tags (and their end tags) do not change font
  HOWEVER, with default font
    cgraphic/xmp change to a monospaced font
    ecgraphic/exmp change back to default (proportional) font
  CURRENTLY, IpfParser does this:
    at cgraphic/xmp, set font to monospaced
    at ecgraphic/exmp, set font to default (no matter what it was before!)
    otherwise we need to support a stack of fonts -- yuck!
    (normally, font changes are not nested and independent of begin/end tags)

margins
  IPF ignores left margin tags inside lists
  outside lists margins are not a nested style

nameits in extra text
  are not prpcessed for tags OR SYMBOLS

symbols in extra text
  Generator doesn't allow symbols for titles, etc so they are converted to chars

:figcap
  officially, any tags in this "extra" text are not allowed
  unofficialy, IPFC allows them
  our parser doesn't (it just passes the raw text)

\n
  normally these are converted to space,
  except when there is no "content" on the line
    AND the line is not empty
